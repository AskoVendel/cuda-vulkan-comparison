# Description:
This project implements image processing FIR filters (high-pass and low-pass) and compares CPU and GPU performance using CUDA and Vulkan. It was developed as part of my thesis.

# Key Features / Skills Demonstrated:

* Image processing algorithms (FIR filters)

* Parallel computing and GPU acceleration

* C++ programming and performance optimization

* Data visualization of filter results and performance metrics

Theses document(including performance metrics) is available [HERE](https://digikogu.taltech.ee/et/Download/d4f2879b-4da0-4b90-b29e-be158d28747e).
